Our team’s analysis of the Level 5 HUD data will analyze national and state trends among the Opportunity Zones. “Opportunities Zones are a place-based incentive that were created...to allocate unrealized capital gains to invest in Qualified Opportunity Funds.” We intend to analyze each census tract and determine the relationship between qualified low income communities and qualified Opportunity Zones across different demographic and socioeconomic indicators to predict shared characteristics that make them eligible. Furthermore, in assessing the relationships between the socioeconomic, housing, and demographic data we will evaluate which factor plays a more significant role in determining its status as a Qualified Opportunity Zone. This is for the purposes of predicting the deciding criteria for designated census tracts.
	
For our method we are using Tableau and Python as our main visualising software and analysis tool for the specific socioeconomic trends and we hope to see positive correlation between census tracts that give an indication of LIC characteristics and the likelihood of those same census tracts falling under Qualified Opportunity Zones. In doing so, we are trying to estimate what makes a census tract eligible. The IRS has not released these criteria, so it would be very interesting to see what patterns are observable.
